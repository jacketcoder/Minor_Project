PUBLICATIONS Computer Aided Automated Lung Nodules Detection System in Computed Tomography April      Many people worldwide die due to cancer and one of them is Lung Cancer  Many times it is caused because of the late diagnosis of the malignant cells present which are difficult to identify  Nodules or lumps present in the lung can be difficult to observe as ribs and vessels are also detected in the radiograph or in tomography  To determine the presence of nodules  a Computer Aided Detection  CAD  system is used on the CT  Computed Tomography  images  Here  we introduce a methodology that makes it easy to interpret whether the nodule is present or not  with the aid of Rule based scheme which offers the choices or deduction in its approach method  The aim is to select effective features and classify the localized abnormal structural change using Rulebased system along with connected component labelling  This accommodates practically removing the unwanted objects i e  the normal structures from the area of interest such as objects too small or too large or objects that are not circular enough  In the proposed methodology  one of the goals is the reduction in false positive rate of nodule detection  The elimination of the unwanted objects can make it possible and the observed nodule can further be determined as malignant or benign by the doctor  Interfacing of MATLAB with Arduino for Object Detection Algorithm Implementation using Serial Communication October      The paper explains proposed algorithm for object detection using image processing and manipulation of the output pin state of Arduino board with ATmega   controller by tracking the motion of the detected object  The object detection algorithm has been developed on MATLAB platform by the combination of several image processing algorithms  Using the theory of Image Acquisition and Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing  the object has been detected in real time  Various features of an object such as the shape  size and color can be used to detect and track the object  The variation in vertical and horizontal axis of detected object is moderated by serial communication port and using serial data communication  the state of Arduino board pin has been controlled  MATLAB programming develops a computer vision system in the real time for object detection and tracking using camera as an image acquisition hardware  Arduino programming provides an interfacing of a hardware prototype with control signals generated by real time object detection and tracking  A brief review of algorithm for Automatic License Plate Recognition  ALPR  System January      This paper explains the intelligent way of surveillance in the road transport system dealing with the traffic rules  Automatic recognition of vehicle number plates for Indian roads is the system to make Indian transportation system Intelligent and safe  License plate recognition system plays major role in the maintenance of traffic rules  Intelligent computer vision based this system follows the image processing algorithm which is a combination of basic morphological algorithm  edge detection algorithm  character segmentation and recognition algorithm and algorithm for character extraction of the captured digital image of the number plate  Among this  character segmentation and recognition is one of the difficult tasks to be done  To make an efficient system  the accuracy of character extraction form number plate should be higher  This system deals with several real time environment based parameters like which are adhesion  lighting condition  rotation  fracture  rivet  yellowness  reflection of light  These parameters degrades the accuracy of character segmentation and recognition  Numerous algorithms by different researchers from different fields were given regarding this system  This paper categorize them and shows the accuracy of them on real time constrain  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Vertex Provision and Vertex Income Tax Domestic  Created and modified the source code for the business logic  the controllers and the services layer  Repaired and enhanced the data layer by adding and maintaining SQL statements and stored procedures  Worked in Microsoft C    MSSQL  Visual Basic Enhancements  Provision calculation performance  Calculation performance was slow due to processing cumulative temporary differences  CTDs  during each run  Performance was improved by reworking the Provision calculation engine to perform the CTD calculation only with a triggering event by using the same strategy as was used for reports performance and interim rollover performance described below  Preliminary results showed an improvement in the provision calculation speed for subsequent reporting periods of           Provision reports performance  Consolidated and worldwide reports were taking an excessively long time to load  One of the reasons for the performance hit was loading report data one entity at a time  Performance was improved by tailoring the same approach as was used for the interim rollover performance to the loading of reports data for the entities  The other reason was an extraneous set of iterations which were necessary only for an old implementation not used by the later reports  This code was modified simply to avoid the extraneous iterations  The time required to load consolidated and worldwide provision reports was improved by           Interim rollover performance  While the user could select multiple entities for interim rollover  data from the source period was being rolled one entity at a time  The code was reworked so that the read write was performed in batches of entity data  The core of this solution was utilizing as a template the team s standard approach to load      byte fields into stored procedure parameters  Interim rollover performance was improved by            Prior year adjustments usability  The prior year adjustments feature was cumbersome from a user s point of view  The functionality was improved by broadening the types of data that can be selected  i e  temporary  permanent  credit  etc   providing popup messages  adding validations  adding caching to allow for users to reverse previous true ups  eliminating memory leaks which were preventing report data from loading  and adding flagging to the key change event  dataset item  allowing prior year adjustment changes to flow to cumulative temporary differences  beginning cumulative differences  tax attributes  tax logic factors and tax destination codes  Override report  Customers expressed a need for an override report for cumulative temporary differences and tax attributes  The Override Report was implemented and displayed beginning balance and prior year valuation allowance for CTDs and tax attributes and the national deferred beginning tax rate for CTDs  Domestic M   improvement  The M   feature had needed improved accuracy for years  The code was reviewed and modified resulting in the improved accuracy of the single  legal and consolidated calculations and reports  A key improvement was the implementation of new methods to provide an algebraic sum of rolled up tax differences at the consolidated entity level  Integration with the International Compliance application  Enabled obligation structure set up to process foreign entities  Updated the suite level component to disallow certain activities appropriate only for the Domestic module  This work also included enhancing the suite level UI components to accommodate the International application  Flexible apportionment project  Implemented the reports code and the server side code which supported the new user interfaces  This feature gave users the ability to customize the apportionment of the income to the various states in which they operate  Export feature  Implemented the server side code and the first iteration of the client side code for the export feature which allowed users to export certain types of data from Vertex Domestic and Provision  New and enhanced reports  All remaining enhancement work during this period consisted of implementing new reports and adding detail to existing reports  The approach to implementing these reports was to load a vector of data according to a format defined by an XML file provided by the Content

This is the company s main product that has multiple workflows relevant to the education sector and reporting capabilities to help universities achieve accreditation  Development wise it has   month release cycle with   weeks of development sprint  Responsibilities    Worked on multiple requirements using following technologies  Java Struts framework  Postgres  Apache  Tomcat and JBoss    Worked on converting certain workflows of the application from struts to use REST API at backend and replaced JSPs with React Redux components  Project  Ctpayment   This is the company s internal accounting software that accepts payment from the customers using PayPal as payment gateway and has multiple workflows related to accounting and also reporting capabilities  Responsibilities    Worked on integration with PayPal to achieve PCI certification    Worked on multiple enhancements to streamline the internal accounting processes    Worked on reports    Development was done in an Agile SDLC process with   week release cycle  Project  Dataloader   This is a software component of the Tk   s campustools application written in Java that loads the data from various sources into the application database so that the campustools application can be integrated with the other softwares used by the universities to collect generate data  example  Blackboard  Moodle  Responsibilities    Designed and implemented a solution to make this component more generic so that it can intelligently handle different types of files and different table structures without any manual changes to the code    Designed and implemented an automated solution with email notifications so that no manual intervention is needed in the entire process  this resulted in a huge improvement in the turnaround time between the time customer provides the data files and the time when the customer sees the data on UI    Designed a solution to improve the performance of this component by replacing the middleware that used Hibernate to fetch objects from database to pure JDBC and SQL statements  Implemented the POC for same and collaborated with the offshore team in India to implement the solution  This solution resulted in around          improvement in file loading speed  Project  Onsite    This is an offline browser app that lets user perform certain workflows in the campustools application in an offline mode and later synch the generated data with the campustools application  Responsibilities    Worked on researching the solutions  determining the architecture and the customer delivery model for this App  Created a POC using REST API using Java s Jersey Jackson library  Postgres  AngularJS  browser s local storage for storing data    Collaborated with offshore team in India to implement various requirements for this product from scratch  Project  Dashboard   The idea to create this Application was to streamline the process of deploying a build on new customer server migrating the existing build to a new build and streamline the communication between various actors like product owners  implementation team and the systems team by enabling product owners to schedule build upgrades installations on customer servers easily through UI instead of creating tickets and as per the schedule the app should install update the builds on the concerned servers without manual interventions  Responsibilities    Designed and implemented this App using React Redux on frontend  Postgres as database  REST API to communicate with the database and Ansible to write deployment migration playbooks    Also designed and implemented a centralised querying solution such that a query can be run across multiple servers and results displayed in a tabular form on UI    Integrated this App with VCentre to access server information required by Ansible playbooks  Project  File Storage   The purpose of this project was to seamlessly store the files uploaded via the campustools application to cloud storage once the local server runs out of space for file storage  Responsibilities    Researched into the solution and decided to use AWS s   implemented a POC such that the file upload location is changed to s  upon reaching the dedicated diskspace limit and then the oncoming files are automatically pushed to s     Integrated the solution implemented in the POC in the campustools App and modified all the file related workflows such that all the file uploads and file access actions go through a common centralised code    This centralised code makes a decision as to where to upload or access the requested file from either s  or local server storage  Software Engineer  R D Enformia       Davidson  NC   September      to March      Project  Enformia tool   This is
