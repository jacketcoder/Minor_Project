["artificial intelligence ai lab no amit kumar patel bct introduction constraint an artificial neural network ann is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the way biological nervous systems such as the brain process information the key element of this paradigm is the novel structure of the information p rocessing system it is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements neurons working in unison to solve specific problems anns like people learn by example an ann is configured for a specific application such as pattern re cognition or data classification through a learning process learning in biological systems involves adjustments to the synaptic connections that exist between the neurons this is true of anns as well why use artificial neural networks artificial neu ral networks with their remarkable ability to derive meaning from complicated or imprecise data can be used to extract patterns and detect trends that are too complex to be noticed by either humans or other computer techniques a trained artificial neura l network can be thought of as an expert in the category of information it has been given to analyze this expert can then be used to provide projections given new situations of interest and answer what if questions other advantages include adap tive learning an ability to learn how to do tasks based on the data given for training or initial experience self organization an ann can create its own organization or representation of the information it receives during learning time real tim e operation ann computations may be carried out in parallel and special hardware devices are being designed and manufactured which take advantage of this capability fault tolerance via redundant information coding partial destruction of a network l eads to the corresponding degradation of performance however some network capabilities may be retained even with major network damage a simple neuron an artificial neuron is a device with many inputs and one output the neuron has two modes of operation the training mode and the using mode in the training mode the neuron can be trained to fire or not for particular input patterns in the using mode when a taught input pattern is detected at the input its associated output becomes the current outp ut if the input pattern does not belong in the taught list of input patterns the firing rule is used to determine whether to fire or not figure a simple neuron network layers the commonest type of artificial neural network consists of three groups or layers of units a layer of input units is connected to a layer of hidden units which is connected to a layer of output units see figure figure a simple feed forward network the activity of the input units represents the raw information that is fed into the network the activity of each hidden unit is determined by the activities of the input units and the weights on the connections between the input and the hidden units the behavior of the output units depends on the ac tivity of the hidden units and the eights between the hidden and output units this simple type of network is interesting because the hidden units are free to construct their own representations of the input the weights between the input and hidden units determine when each hidden unit is active and so by modifying these weights a hidden unit can choose what it represents we also distinguish single layer and multi layer architectures the single layer organization in which all units are connected to one another constitutes the most general case and is of more potential computat ional power than hierarchically structured multi layer organizations in multilayer networks units are often numbered by layer instead of following a global numbering perceptrons the most influential work on neural nets in the s went under the head ing of perceptrons a term coined by frank rosenblatt the perceptron see figure turns out to be an mcp model neuron with weighted inputs with some additional fixed pre processing units labeled a a aj ap are called association units and their task is to extract specific localized featured from the input images perceptrons mimic the basic idea behind the mammalian visual system they were mainly used in pattern recognition even though their capabilities extended a lot more figure a perceptron transfer functions the behavior of an ann depends on both the weights and the input output function transfer function that is specified for the units this function typically falls into one of three categories for linear or ramp the output activity is proportional to the total weighted output for threshold units the output is set at one of two levels depending on whether the total input is greater than or less than some threshold value for sigmoid units the out put varies continuously but not linearly as the input changes sigmoid units bear a greater resemblance to real neurons than do linear or threshold units but all three must be considered rough approximations to make an artificial neural network that pe rforms some specific task we must choose how the units are connected to one another and we must set the weights on the connections appropriately the connections determine whether it is possible for one unit to influence another the weights specify the s trength of the influence we can teach a network to perform a particular task by using the following procedure we present the network with training examples which consist of a pattern of activities for the input units together with the desired pattern of activities for the output units we determine how closely the actual output of the network matches the desired output we change the weight of each connection so that the network produces a better approximation of the desired output implementation of logic functions in this practical we will learn how basic logic functions can be implemented and trained using matlab the primitive procedure is explained by implementing a input and gate x column for inputs zi column for true output program generate and function using mcculloch pitts neural net

without any external intervention or interaction for a large number of times times here in each loop for every pair of inputs we calculate all the outputs at each layer and instead of a threshold we use activation function and then we calculate the adjusted weights and enter the next loop after the network gets trained we can check for an in put for example we provided and and got as the output which is close to conclusion hence we can develop neural networks for various gates like nand nor or using mcculloh pits approach and also the bipolar approach we can also develop xor gate using

introduction to first order predicate logic fopl first order logic first order logic is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics philosophy linguistics and computer science first order logic

artificial neural network ann is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the way biological nervous systems such as the brain process information the idea of anns is based on the belief that working of human brain by making the right connections can be imitated using silicon and wires a s living neurons and dendrites the human brain is composed of billion nerve cells called neurons they are connected to other thousand cells by axons stimuli from e xternal environment or inputs from sensory organs are accepted by dendrites these inputs create electric impulses which quickly travel through the neural network a neuron can then send the message to other neuron to handle the issue or does not send it forward anns are composed of multiple nodes which imitate biological neurons of human brain the neurons are connected by links and they interact with each other the nodes can take input data and perform simple operations on the data the result of thes e operations is passed to other neurons the output at each node is called its activation or node value each link is associated with weight anns are capable of learning which takes place by altering weight values the following illustration shows a simp machine learning in anns supervised learning example the teacher feeds some example data about which the teacher already knows the answers for example pattern

thapa bct submitted to department of electronics and computer engineering pulchowk campus lalitpur neural networks anns are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains bas ed on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons analogous to axons in a biological brain su ch systems learn progressively improve performance to do tasks by considering examples generally without task specific programming for example in image recognition they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as cat or no cat and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images each connection synapse between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron the receiving postsynaptic neuron can process the signal s and then signal downstream neurons connected to it neurons may have state generally represented by real numbers typically between and neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learni ng proceeds which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream further they may have a threshold such that only if the aggregate signal is below or above that level is the downstream signal sent typically neurons are organized in layers different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs signals travel from the first input to the last output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times the original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would over time attention focused on matching specific mental abilities leading to deviations from biology such as back propagation or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including comp uter vision speech recognition machine translatio n social network filtering playing board and video games medical diagnosis and in many other domains the most common type of artificial neural network consists of three groups or layers of units a layer of input units is connected to a layer of hidden units which is connected to a layer of output units perceptrons the most influential work on neural nets in the s went under the heading of perceptrons a term coined by frank rosenblatt the perceptron see figure turns out to be an mcp model neuron with weighted inputs with some additional fixed pre pr ocessing units labeled a a aj ap are called association units and their task is to extract specific localized featured from the input images perceptrons mimic the basic idea behind the mammalian visual system they were mainly used in pattern reco gnition even though their capabilities extended a lot more transfer functions the behavior of an ann depends on both the weights and the input output function transfer function that is specified for the units this function typically falls into on e of three categories for linear or ramp the output activity is proportional to the total weighted output for threshold units the output is set at one of two levels depending on whether the total input is greater than or less than some threshold va lue for sigmoid units the output varies continuously but not linearly as the input changes sigmoid units bear a greater resemblance to real neurons than do linear or threshold units but all three must be considered rough approximations assignmen t output assignment nand clear clc w input weight w for nand gate

types of projects such as waterfall spiral iterative and v shaped but all of them and other lack flexibility to deal with other kinds of projects like object oriented object oriented software engineering oose is an object modeling language and methodology the approach of using object oriented techniques for designing a system is referred to as object oriented design object oriented development approaches are best suited to projects that will imply systems using emerging object technologies to construct manage and assemble those objects into useful computer applications object oriented design is the continuation of object oriented analysis continuing to center the development focus on object modeling techniques keywords s software engineering traditional approach object oriented approach analysis design deployment test me thodology compariso n between traditional approach and object oriented approach i i ntroduction all software especially large pieces of software produced by many people should be produced using some kind of methodology even small pieces of software developed by one person c an be improved by keeping a methodology in mind a methodology is a systematic way of doing things it is a repeatable process that we can follow from the earliest stages of software development through to the maintenance of an installed system as well as the process a methodology should specify what we re expected to produce as we follow the process a methodology will also include recommendation or techniques for resource management planning scheduling and other management tasks good widely availabl e methodologies are essential for a mature software industry a good methodology will address at least the following issues planning scheduling resourcing workflows activities roles artifacts education there are a number of phases common to every development regardless of methodology starting with requirements capture and ending with maintenance during the last few decades a number of software development models have been proposed and discussed within the software engineering community with the traditional approach you re expected to move forward gracefully from one phase to the other with the modern approach on the other hand you re allowed to perform each phase m ore than once and in any order ii t raditional a pproach there are a n umber of phases common to every development regardless of methodology starting with requirements capture and ending with maintenance with the traditional approach will be expected to move forward gracefully from one phase to the other the list below d escribes the common phases in software development a requirements requirements capture is about discovering what is going to achieve with new piece of software and has two aspects business modeling involves understanding the context in which software will operate a system requirement modeling or functional specification means deciding what capabilities the new soft ware will have and writing down those capabilities b analysis analysis means understanding what are dealing with before design ing a solution it need s to be clear about the relevant entities their properties and their inter relationships also need s to be able to verify understanding this can involve customers and end users since they re like ly to be subject matter experts c design in the design phase will work out how to solve the problem in other words make decisions based on experience estimation and intuition about what software which will write and how will deploy it system design breaks the system down into logical subsystems processes and physical subsystems computers and networks decides how machines will comm unicate and chooses the right techn ologies for the job and so on d specification specification is an often ignored or at least often neglected phase the term specification is used in different ways by different developers for example the output of the requirements phase is a specification of what the system must be able to do the output of analysis is a specification of what are dealing with and so on ijacsa international journal of advanced computer science and applications vol no page www ijacsa thesai org code test system information engineering analysis design e implementation in this phase is writing pieces of code that work together to form subsys tems which in turn collaborate to form the whole system the sort of the task which is carried out during the implementation phase is write the method bodies for the inventory class in such a way that they conform to their specification f testing w hen the software is complete it must be tested against the system requirements to see if it fits the original goals it is a good idea for programmers to perform small tests as they go along to improve the quality of the code that they deliver g depl oyment in the deployment phase are concerned with getting the hardware and software to the end users along with manuals and training materials this may be a complex process involving a gradual planned transition from the old way of working to the new one h maintenance when the system is deployed it has only just been born a long life stretches before it during which it has to stand up to everyday use this is where the real testing happens the sort of the problem which is discovered discover during the maintenance phase is when the log on window opens it still contains the last password entered as the software developers we normally interested in maintenance because of the faults bugs that are found in software must find the faults and remove them as quickly as possible rolling out fixed versions of the software to keep the end users happy as well as faults users may discover deficiencies things that the system should do but doesn t and extra requirements things that wou ld improve the system figure the linear sequential model iii o bject o riented a pproach in object oriented approach a system is viewed as a set of objects all object orientation experts agree that a good methodology is essential for software development especially when working in teams thus quite a few methodologies have been invente d over the last decade broadly speaking all object oriented methodologies are alike they have similar phases and similar artifacts but there are many small differences object oriented methodologies tend not to be too prescriptive the developers are given some choice about whether they use a particular type of diagram for example therefore the development team must select a methodology and agree which artifacts are to be produced before they do any detailed planning or scheduling in general eac h methodology addresses the philosophy behind each of the phases the workflows and the individual activities within each phase the artifacts that should be produced diagrams textual descriptions and code dependencies between the artifacts notations for the different kinds of artifact s the need to model static structure and dynamic behavior static modeling involves deciding what the logical or physical parts of the system should be and how they should be connected together dynamic modeling is abou t deciding how the static parts should collaborate roughly speaking static modeling describes how we construct and initialize the system while dynamic modeling describes how the system should behave when it s running typically we produce at least one static model and one dynamic model during each phase of the development some methodologies especially the more comprehensive ones have alternative development paths geared to different types and sizes of development the benefits of object oriente d development are reduced time to market greater product flexibility and schedule predictability and the risks of them are performance and start up costs a analysis the aim of the analysis process is to analyze specify and define the system which i s to be built in this phase we build models that will make it easier for us to understand the system the models that are developed during analysis are oriented fully to the application and not the implementation environment they are essential models that are independent of such things as operating system programming language dbms processor distribution or hardware configuration two different models are developed in analysis the requirements model and the analysis model these are based on requi rement specifications and discussions with the prospective users the first model the requirements model should make it possible to delimit the system and to define what functionality should take place within it for this purpose we develop a conceptual picture of the system using problem domain objects and also specific interface descriptions of the system if it is meaningful for this system we also describe the system as a number of use cases that are performed by a number of actor s the analysis model is an architectural model used for analysis of robustness it gives a conceptual configuration of the system consisting of various object classes active controllers domain entities and interface objects the purpose of this model is to find a robust and extensible structure for the system as a base for construction each of the object types has its own special purpose for this robustness and together they will offer the total functionality that was specified in the requirements mo del to manage the development the analysis model may combine objects into subsystems ijacsa international journal of advanced computer science and applications vol no page www ijacsa thesai org b construction we build our system through construction based on the analysis model and the requirements model created by the analysis process the construction process lasts until the coding is completed and the included units have been tested there are three main reas ons for a construction process the analysis model is not sufficiently formal adaptation must be made to the actual implementation environment we want t o do internal validation of the analysis results the construction activity produces two models th e design model and the implementation model construction is thus divided into two phases design and implementation each of which develops a model the design model is a further refinement and formalization of the analysis model where consequences of the implementation environment have been taken into account the implementation model is the actual implementation code of the system c testing testing is an activity to verify that a correct system is being built testing is traditionally an expensive activity primarily because many faults are not detected until late in the development to do effective testing we must have as a goal that every test should detect a fault unit testing is performed to test a specific unit where a unit can be of varying size from a class up to an entire subsystem the unit is initially tested structurally that is white box testing this means that we use our knowledge of the inside of the unit to test it we have various coverage criteria for the test the minimum be ing to cover all statements however coverage criteria can be hard to define due to polymorphism many branches are made implicit in an object oriented system however polymorphism also enhances the independence of each object making them easier to tes t as standalone units the use of inheritance also complicates testing since we may need to retest operations at different levels in the inheritance hierarchy on the other hand since we typically have less code there is less to test specification test ing of a unit is done primarily from the object protocol so called black box testing here we use equivalence partitioning to find appropriate test cases test planning must be done early along with the identification and specification of tests d u ml by the mid s the best known methodologies were those invented by ivar jacobson james rumbaugh and grady booch each had his own consulting company using his own methodology and his own notation by jacobson and rumbaugh had joined rational c orporation and they had developed a set of notations which became known as the unified modeling language uml the

its users or by other systems a use case diagram shows how system use cases are related to each other and how the users can get at them each bubble on a use case diagram represents a use case and each stick person represents a user figure depicts a car rental store accessible over the internet from this picture we can extract a lot of information quite easily for example an assistant can make a

diagram shows which classes exist in the business during analysis or in the system itself during subsystem design figure shows an example of an analysis level class diagram with each class represented

technology or tool invented by human beings all se methodologies have limitations t he software engineering develop ment has two ways to develop the projects that traditional approach and object oriented approach the traditional a pproach uses traditional projects that use d in development of their procedural programming like c this approach leads software developers to focus on decomposition of larger algorithms into smaller ones the object oriented approach uses to development t he object oriented projects that use the object oriented programming like c and java the object oriented approach to software development has a decided advantage over the traditional approach in dealing with complexity and the fact that most contempora ry languages and tools are object oriented finally some topics can be suggested for future works design the model that includes the features of traditional approach and object oriented approach to develop and deals with different projects in software

synaptic connections that exist between the neurons this is true of anns as well why use artificial neural networks artificial neu ral networks with their remarkable ability to derive meaning from complicated or imprecise data can be used to extract patterns and detect trends that are too complex to be noticed by either humans or other computer techniques a trained artificial neura l network can be thought of as an expert in the category of information it has been given to analyze this expert can then be used to provide projections given new situations of interest and answer what if questions other advantages include adap tive learning an ability to learn how to do tasks based on the data given for training or initial experience self organization an ann can create its own organization or representation of the information it receives during learning time real tim e operation ann computations may be carried out in parallel and special hardware devices are being designed and manufactured which take advantage of this capability fault tolerance via redundant information coding partial destruction of a network l eads to the corresponding degradation of performance however some network capabilities may be retained even with major network damage a simple neuron an artificial neuron is a device with many inputs and one output the neuron has two modes of operation the training mode and the using mode in the training mode the neuron can be trained to fire or not for particular input patterns in the using mode when a taught input pattern is detected at the input its associated output becomes the current outp ut if the input pattern does not belong in the taught list of input patterns the firing rule is used to determine whether to fire or not figure a simple neuron network layers the commonest type of artificial neural network consists of three groups or layers of units a layer of input units is connected to a layer of hidden units which is connected to a layer of output units see figure figure a simple feed forward network the activity of the input units represents the raw information that is fed into the network the activity of each hidden unit is determined by the activities of the input units and the weights on the connections between the input and the hidden units the behavior of the output units depends on the ac tivity of the hidden units and the eights between the hidden and output units this simple type of network is interesting because the hidden units are free to construct their own representations of the input the weights between the input and hidden units determine when each hidden unit is active and so by modifying these weights a hidden unit can choose what it represents we also distinguish single layer and multi layer architectures the single layer organization in which all units are connected to one another constitutes the most general case and is of more potential computat ional power than hierarchically structured multi layer organizations in multilayer networks units are often numbered by layer instead of following a global numbering perceptrons the most influential work on neural nets in the s went under the head ing of perceptrons a term coined by frank rosenblatt the perceptron see figure turns out to be an mcp model neuron with weighted inputs with some additional fixed pre processing units labeled a a aj ap are called association units and their task is to extract specific localized featured from the input images perceptrons mimic the basic idea behind the mammalian visual system they were mainly used in pattern recognition even though their capabilities extended a lot more figure a perceptron transfer functions the behavior of an ann depends on both the weights and the input output function transfer function that is specified for the units this function typically falls into one of three categories for linear or ramp the output activity is proportional to the total weighted output for threshold units the output is set at one of two levels depending on whether the total input is greater than or less than some threshold value for sigmoid units the out put varies continuously but not linearly as the input changes sigmoid units bear a greater resemblance to real neurons than do linear or threshold units but all three must be considered rough approximations to make an artificial neural network that pe rforms some specific task we must choose how the units are connected to one another and we must set the weights on the connections appropriately the connections determine whether it is possible for one unit to influence another the weights specify the s trength of the influence we can teach a network to perform a particular task by using the following procedure we present the network with training examples which consist of a pattern of activities for the input units together with the desired pattern of activities for the output units we determine how closely the actual output of the network matches the desired output we change the weight of each connection so that the network produces a better approximation of the desired output

in the backpropagation method we initially assign some values to the weights and then we repeat to adjust the weights without any external intervention or interaction for a large number of times times

next loop after the network gets trained we can check for an in put for example we provided and and got as the output which is close to conclusion hence we can develop neural networks for various

that is inspired by the way biological nervous systems such as the brain process information the idea of anns is based on the belief that working of human brain by making the right connections can be imitated using silicon and wires a s living neurons and dendrites the human brain is composed of billion nerve cells called neurons they are connected to other thousand cells by axons stimuli from e xternal environment or inputs from sensory organs are accepted by dendrites these inputs create electric impulses which quickly travel through the neural network a neuron can then send the message to other neuron to handle the issue or does not send it forward anns are composed of multiple nodes which imitate biological neurons of human brain the neurons are connected by links and they interact with each other the nodes can take input data and perform simple operations on the data the result of thes e operations is passed to other neurons the output at each node is called its activation or node value each link is associated with weight anns are capable of learning which takes place by altering weight values the following illustration shows a simp machine learning in anns supervised learning example the teacher feeds some example data about which the teacher already knows the answers for example pattern recognizing the ann comes up with guesses while recognizing then the teacher provides the ann with the answers the network then compares it unsupervised learning answers for example searching for a hidden pattern in this case clustering i e dividing a set of elements i nto

campus lalitpur neural networks anns are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains bas ed on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons analogous to axons in a biological brain su ch systems learn progressively improve performance to do tasks by considering examples generally without task specific programming for example in image recognition they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as cat or no cat and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images each connection synapse between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron the receiving postsynaptic neuron can process the signal s and then signal downstream neurons connected to it neurons may have state generally represented by real numbers typically between and neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learni ng proceeds which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream further they may have a threshold such that only if the aggregate signal is below or above that level is the downstream signal sent typically neurons are organized in layers different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs signals travel from the first input to the last output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times the original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would over time attention focused on matching specific mental abilities leading to deviations from biology such as back propagation or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including comp uter vision speech recognition machine translatio n social network filtering playing board and video games medical diagnosis and in many other domains the most common type of artificial neural network consists of three groups or layers of units a layer of input units is connected to a layer of hidden units which is connected to a layer of output units perceptrons the most influential work on neural nets in the s went under the heading of perceptrons a term coined by frank rosenblatt the perceptron see figure turns out to be an mcp model neuron with weighted inputs with some additional fixed pre pr ocessing units labeled a a aj ap are called association units and their task is to extract specific localized featured from the input images perceptrons mimic the basic idea behind the mammalian visual system they were mainly used in pattern reco gnition even though their capabilities extended a lot more transfer functions the behavior of an ann depends on both the weights and the input output function transfer function that is specified for the units this function typically falls into on e of three categories for linear or ramp the output activity is proportional to the total weighted output for threshold units the output is set at one of two levels depending on whether the total input is greater than or less than some threshold va lue for sigmoid units the output varies continuously but not linearly as the input changes sigmoid units bear a greater resemblance to real neurons than do linear or threshold units but all three must be considered

approaches and object oriented approach traditional approach has a lot of models that deal with different types of projects such as waterfall spiral iterative and v shaped but all of them and other lack flexibility to deal with other kinds of projects like object oriented object oriented software engineering oose is an object modeling language and methodology the approach of using object oriented techniques for designing a system is referred to as object oriented design object oriented development approaches are best suited to projects that will imply systems using emerging object technologies to construct manage and assemble those objects into useful computer applications object oriented design is the continuation of object oriented analysis continuing to center the development focus on object modeling techniques keywords s software engineering traditional approach object oriented approach analysis design deployment test me thodology compariso n between traditional approach and object oriented approach i i ntroduction all software especially large pieces of software produced by many people should be produced using some kind of methodology even small pieces of software developed by one person c an be improved by keeping a methodology in mind a methodology is a systematic way of doing things it is a repeatable process that we can follow from the earliest stages of software development through to the maintenance of an installed system as well as the process a methodology should specify what we re expected to produce as we follow the process a methodology will also include recommendation or techniques for resource management planning scheduling and other management tasks good widely availabl e methodologies are essential for a mature software industry a good methodology will address at least the following issues planning scheduling resourcing workflows activities roles artifacts education there are a number of phases common to every development regardless of methodology starting with requirements capture and ending with maintenance during the last few decades a number of software development models have been proposed and discussed within the software engineering community with the traditional approach you re expected to move forward gracefully from one phase to the other with the modern approach on the other hand you re allowed to perform each phase m ore than once and in any order ii t raditional a pproach there are a n umber of phases common to every development regardless of methodology starting with requirements capture and ending with maintenance with the traditional approach will be expected to move forward gracefully from one phase to the other the list below d escribes the common phases in software development a requirements requirements capture is about discovering what is going to achieve with new piece of software and has two aspects business modeling involves understanding the context in which software will operate a system requirement modeling or functional specification means deciding what capabilities the new soft ware will have and writing down those capabilities b analysis analysis means understanding what are dealing with before design ing a solution it need s to be clear about the relevant entities their properties and their inter relationships also need s to be able to verify understanding this can involve customers and end users since they re like ly to be subject matter experts c design in the design phase will work out how to solve the problem in other words make decisions based on experience estimation and intuition about what software which will write and how will deploy it system design breaks the system down into logical subsystems processes and physical subsystems computers and networks decides how machines will comm unicate and chooses the right techn ologies for the job and so on d specification specification is an often ignored or at least often neglected phase the term specification is used in different ways by different developers for example the output of the requirements phase is a specification of what the system must be able to do the output of analysis is a specification of what are dealing with and so on ijacsa international journal of advanced computer science and applications vol no page www ijacsa thesai org code test system information engineering analysis design e implementation in this phase is writing pieces of code that work together to form subsys tems which in turn collaborate to form the whole system the sort of the task which is carried out during the implementation phase is write the method bodies for the inventory class in such a way that they conform to their specification f testing w hen the software is complete it must be tested against the system requirements to see if it fits the original goals it is a good idea for programmers to perform small tests as they go along to improve the quality of the code that they deliver g depl oyment in the deployment phase are concerned with getting the hardware and software to the end users along with manuals and training materials this may be a complex process involving a gradual planned transition from the old way of working to the new one h maintenance when the system is deployed it has only just been born a long life stretches before it during which it has to stand up to everyday use this is where the real testing happens the sort of the problem which is discovered discover during the maintenance phase is when the log on window opens it still contains the last password entered as the software developers we normally interested in maintenance because of the faults bugs that are found in software must find the faults and remove them as quickly as possible rolling out fixed versions of the software to keep the end users happy as well as faults users may discover deficiencies things that the system should do but doesn t and extra requirements things that wou ld improve the system figure the linear sequential model iii o bject o riented a pproach in object oriented approach a system is viewed as a set of objects all object orientation experts agree that a good methodology is essential for software development especially when working in teams thus quite a few methodologies have been invente d over the last decade broadly speaking all object oriented methodologies are alike they have similar phases and similar artifacts but there are many small differences object oriented methodologies tend not to be too prescriptive the developers are given some choice about whether they use a particular type of diagram for example therefore the development team must select a methodology and agree which artifacts are to be produced before they do any detailed planning or scheduling in general eac h methodology addresses the philosophy behind each of the phases the workflows and the individual activities within each phase the artifacts that should be produced diagrams textual descriptions and code dependencies between the artifacts notations for the different kinds of artifact s the need to model static structure and dynamic behavior static modeling involves deciding what the logical or physical parts of the system should be and how they should be connected together dynamic modeling is abou t deciding how the static parts should collaborate roughly speaking static modeling describes how we construct and initialize the system while dynamic modeling describes how the system should behave when it s running typically we produce at least one static model and one dynamic model during each phase of the development some methodologies especially the more comprehensive ones have alternative development paths geared to different types and sizes of development the benefits of object oriente d development are reduced time to market greater product flexibility and schedule predictability and the risks of them are performance and start up costs a analysis the aim of the analysis process is to analyze specify and define the system which i s to be built in this phase we build models that will make it easier for us to understand the system the models that are developed during analysis are oriented fully to the application and not the implementation environment they are essential models that are independent of such things as operating system programming language dbms processor distribution or hardware configuration two different models are developed in analysis the requirements model and the analysis model these are based on requi rement specifications and discussions with the prospective users the first model the requirements model should make it possible to delimit the system and to define what functionality should take place within it for this purpose we develop a conceptual picture of the system using problem domain objects and also specific interface descriptions of the system if it is meaningful for this system we also describe the system as a number of use cases that are performed by a number of actor s the analysis model is an architectural model used for analysis of robustness it gives a conceptual configuration of the system consisting of various object classes active controllers domain entities and interface objects the purpose of this model is to find a robust and extensible structure for the system as a base for construction each of the object types has its own special purpose for this robustness and together they will offer the total functionality that was specified in the requirements mo del to manage the development the analysis model may combine objects into subsystems ijacsa international journal of advanced computer science and applications vol no page www ijacsa thesai org b construction we build our system through construction based on the analysis model and the requirements model created by the analysis process the construction process lasts until the coding is completed and the included units have been tested there are three main reas ons for a construction process the analysis model is not sufficiently formal adaptation must be made to the actual implementation environment we want t o do internal validation of the analysis results the construction activity produces two models th e design model and the implementation model construction is thus divided into two phases design and implementation each of which develops a model the design model is a further refinement and formalization of the analysis model where consequences of the implementation environment have been taken into account the implementation model is the actual implementation code of the system c testing testing is an activity to verify that a correct system is being built testing is traditionally an expensive activity primarily because many faults are not detected until late in the development to do effective testing we must have as a goal that every test should detect a fault unit testing is performed to test a specific unit where a unit can be of varying size from a class up to an entire subsystem the unit is initially tested structurally that is white box testing this means that we use our knowledge of the inside of the unit to test it we have various coverage criteria for the test the minimum be ing to cover all statements however coverage criteria can be hard to define due to polymorphism many branches are made implicit in an object oriented system however polymorphism also enhances the independence of each object making them easier to tes t as standalone units the use of inheritance also complicates testing since we may need to retest operations at different levels in the inheritance hierarchy on the other hand since we typically have less code there is less to test specification test ing of a unit is done primarily from the object protocol so called black box testing here we use equivalence partitioning to find appropriate test cases test planning must be done early along with the identification and specification of tests d u ml by the mid s the best known methodologies were those invented by ivar jacobson james rumbaugh and grady booch each had his own consulting company using his own methodology and his own notation by jacobson and rumbaugh had joined rational c orporation

to each other and how the users can get at them each bubble on a use case diagram represents a use case and each stick person represents a user figure depicts a car rental store accessible over the

limitations t he software engineering develop ment has two ways to develop the projects that traditional approach and object oriented approach the traditional a pproach uses traditional projects that use d in development of their procedural programming like c this approach leads software developers to focus on decomposition of larger algorithms into smaller ones the object oriented approach uses to development t he object oriented projects that use the object oriented programming like c and java the object oriented approach to software development has a decided advantage over the traditional approach in dealing with complexity and the fact that most contempora ry languages and tools are object oriented finally some topics can be suggested for future works design the model that includes the features of traditional approach and object oriented approach to develop and deals with different projects in software e ngineering updating some traditional approach to be able to use different
